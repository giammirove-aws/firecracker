//! A device-generic worker thread for one virtio queue group.
//!
//! A *queue group* is the set of virtqueues that must be processed by the same thread because they
//! share mutable state. For virtio-block that is a single queue; for virtio-net it is the RX/TX
//! pair, because the TX path synchronously re-enters the RX path to service MMDS and both
//! directions mutate the same MMDS network stack.
//!
//! The split of responsibilities is:
//!
//! * [`QueueGroupWorker`] is the device-specific half. It owns its queues, queue eventfds and
//!   backend **by value**, so the borrow checker — rather than a convention or a lock — guarantees
//!   that only the worker thread touches the data path while the device is activated.
//! * [`WorkerShell`] is the device-independent half that runs inside the thread: the lifecycle
//!   state machine plus the [`MutEventSubscriber`] glue.
//! * [`WorkerHandle`] is the VMM-side half: the control channel, the wake-up eventfd and the join
//!   handle.
//!
//! Threads are created once per queue group *before* activation and park until
//! [`WorkerHandle::start`] hands them their resources. On cold boot and snapshot restore they are
//! created before the VMM thread installs its seccomp filter; a hotplugged drive creates them at
//! runtime, which is why that filter allows `clone`.
